<br> <strong> Welcome to Zhenyu's website! </strong>

I'm Zhenyu Sun, and you can also call me Walker or Sorry. These two nicknames come from the names and songs of two musicians. I am now an undergraduate of South China University of Technology at Guangzhou, China, and" <a href="/Zhenyu_Sun_Personal_CV.pdf">here</a> "is my CV for more specific information.

"My research so far has concentrated on 3D-Reconstruction and Generative AI. As I deepen my exploration of Generative models and 3D Reconstruction methods, my goal is to achieve the alignment and interaction between textual information and 3D scene presentation, and to establish a strong mapping between the two on LLM (Large Language Models), providing the cornerstone of Platonic cognition for strong artificial intelligence."

<strong><span style="color:red; font-size:larger;">Sincerely looking for 26fall Ph.D position!</span></strong>
<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
